## Summary

I build things: software, teams and companies. My experience writing software runs the gamut from building greenfield products end to end, engineering distributed systems, tuning high scale software, and fighting the technical debt that rapid scaling inevitably accumulates. My experience building teams specializes in recruiting high potential individuals and creating an environment where they can rapidly level up.

## Experience

### Opsee - CEO / Co-founder
*March 2015 - Present*

I implemented the prototype of our product, from backend to frontend, recruited a founding team and raised funding. From there, I built a well rounded and effective product team to take the product vision from prototype to a market ready product. Since the start of the year I've been focusing exclusively on marketing the product, evangelizing to the developer community and ultimately trying to get our product into the hands of as many engineers as possible.

### Boundary - CTO / Co-founder
*2010 - February 2015*

At Boundary I implemented the prototype for the backend of the product, originally envisioned as a "Google Analytics for network data". I hacked together a prototype by repurposing the Cassandra storage engine with whole new read and write paths. The prototype got us funding and from there we built the team and developed our technology into a soft real-time streaming analytics system. We were the first commercial monitoring company to offer streaming analytics and streaming dataviz, giving customers unparalleled insights into their network infrastructure. At its peak, Boundary's streaming system was processing over a terabit of data per second, and over a million records per second for our largest customers.

### Powerset - Engineer
*2007 - 2010*

At Powerset I started as a run of the mill Ruby on Rails monkey. My responsibility quickly expanded, however, after half my team quit, leaving us shorthanded in the run up to launch. Despite a dire deadline and crazed requirements like rebuilding our infrastructure from scratch in EC2 a week before launch, I managed to exceed the deadline by pushing the launch button before the press embargo lifted. At Powerset I also wrote one of the first OSS implementations of Amazon's Dynamo paper, helping kick off the NoSQL movement.

### Chariot Solutions - Enterprise Architect
*2005 - 2007*

Chariot is a consulting shop specializing in IT Janitorial Services for Enterprises in and around Philadelphia. Typically, we got called in whenever either the internal team, management or both had turned a project into an intractable morass. Rotating between contracts for Chariot gave me a great deal of insight into the failure modes for IT projects at a very early point in my career, and how best to turn them around if it was possible.

### Fort Hill Company - Architect
* 2004 - 2005*

I grew up in Delaware, and Fort Hill Company was one of the few software development companies actually located in the state at the time. Oddly, Fort Hill wound up being a breeding ground for more than its fair share of world class technologists: Brian McAllister, now the CTO of platform at Groupon, Mark Chadwick, formerly Chief Architect of Invite Media, and myself of course. Fort Hill is where we all cut our teeth, building and operating a SaaS product back when they were called ASPs.

## Education
